# Staff-Utilities
The Github for the Staff Utilities Skript!

This skript is a very useful skript which has extremely clearly divided sections and explains what part works for which section!

The skript includes features such as:
- Reloading skript broadcast
- Join/leave for new joins, members, donators, and staff
- Staff chat
- Fake join and leave broadcasts for staff
- Hide join/leave broadcasts for staff [if true, you will automatically be vanished on join, if you have Essentials]
- Allowing setting specific broadcasts to false (including reloading skript, staff join/leave, donator join/leave, member join/leave, and first join)

I am planning on adding some more features, which can be found on the trello:

For any updates I will make on the skript, I suggest checking out the SpigotMC link for it, as that is where I will explain the changes in detail!

If you have any ideas or suggestions for this, please let me know! And feel free to contact me if you have any questions! I will try my best to answer all of them!

#Please keep in mind that you are allowed to share this skript with anyone you like, however please make sure to tell them who the creator of the skript is! Also, please do not sell this skript to anyone at any point as this is a completely free skript. Those are the only rules I have for this! Otherwise, do whatever you please with it!
